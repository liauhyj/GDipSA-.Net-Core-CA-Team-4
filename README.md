# GDipSA .Net Core-CA Team 4

This is Team 4's submission for one of the CAs we were assigned as part of our coursework in the GDipSA programme.

The objective of this CA is to create a shopping cart page.

Jon's Branch is the branch where I did most of my work.
I also worked on the master branch.

## An overview of what I did for this project

1) Coded 4 out of the 6 controllers (i.e. all controllers except Checkout Controller and MyPurchasesController
2) Created and seeded the database in the Db folder.
3) Coded everything in the Middleware folder.
4) Did most of the .cs files in the Model folder. (i.e all except ActivationKey, AtvKeyInput, Purchase, PurchaseDetail and PurGroupedByPdt)
5) Did the product.data in the SeedDate folder.
6) Did the razor code and html layout(without images and beautification) for Index.cshtml for Cart, Home, Login folders and _Layout.cshtml in the Shared fodler.
