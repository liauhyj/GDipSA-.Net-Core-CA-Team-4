# GDipSA .Net Core CA Team 4

This is Team 4's submission for one of the CAs we were assigned as part of our coursework in the GDipSA programme.

In order to run the code smoothly, please change the server name "DbConn": "Server=(local);Database=Software4You;Trusted_Connection=True;" in appsettings.json.

Jon's Branch is the branch where I did my work.

I also worked on the master branch.
